			Projecting Your Data
		</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<img src="./assets/preview.gif" style="width: 20vw;">
		<p>
			An embedding is a map from input data to points in Euclidean space. 
			In most machine learning applications, the model will transform high-dimensional vectors into a relatively low-dimensional space to make other processes.
			For example, in the case of image classification, usually, the model needs to transform the input image into a high-dimensional vector known as embeddings after a series of operations and identify the category of the input image based on the value of the embedding output from the model. 
			At the same time, the embeddings from the same category should be close to each other in the high-dimensional space. 
			In other words, the Euclidean distance from the same category should be minimized.
			And Researchers often need to explore the properties of a specific embedding to understand the behavior of their model.
			For these users, gaining an understanding of embedding geometry is a key step in interpreting a machine learning model. 
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the most approachable ways to analyze embeddings is to represent them visually. 
			However, since embeddings usually exist as high-dimensional vectors, it is necessary to use dimensionality reduction to project the embeddings into a 2D or 3D space that humans can easily understand and analyze.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this assignment, students need to build a classification model using the MNIST dataset and build an interactive embedding projector using tensorboard. 
			Finally, students are required to interpret the behavior of the model based on different dimensionality reduction algorithms.
		</p>
		<p>
			Instructors are allowed to modify the sample program based on their needs, including changing the dataset or the model architecture, etc.
